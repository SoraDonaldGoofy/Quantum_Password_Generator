# Quantum_Password_Generator

This is a program that allows a person to make a random password that consists of uppercase characters, lowercase characters, numbers, and special symbols.
The highlight of this program is the Hadamard gate that introduces the randomness.
The program will run the quantum circuit depending on the length of the password the user desires.
